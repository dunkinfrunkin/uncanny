# Perplexity Analyzer

Measures how "surprised" a language model is by the text. AI-generated text has low perplexity (the model predicted it easily). Human text has high perplexity (surprising word choices).

:::note
This analyzer requires optional ML dependencies: `pip install "uncanny[ml]"`
:::

## How It Works

1. **Load GPT-2 small** — a ~500MB language model (downloaded on first use)
2. **Compute perplexity** — for each sentence, calculate the exponential of the cross-entropy loss
3. **Score** — map perplexity to a 0-1 scale using a log-scale sigmoid

## Perplexity Explained

Perplexity measures how well a language model predicts the next token. Lower perplexity = more predictable text.

- **AI text**: perplexity ~10-60 (the model "agrees" with itself)
- **Human text**: perplexity ~60-300+ (surprising, creative, or unconventional)

## Installation

```bash
pip install "uncanny[ml]"
```

This installs:
- `torch` (~800MB)
- `transformers` (~500MB)
- GPT-2 small model (~500MB, downloaded on first use)

## Usage

```bash
# Deep mode enables perplexity
uncanny scan report.md --deep

# Or explicitly
uncanny scan report.md --analyzers compression,burstiness,perplexity
```

## Device Support

The analyzer automatically detects:
- **CUDA** (NVIDIA GPUs)
- **MPS** (Apple Silicon)
- **CPU** (fallback)

## Strengths

- Strong signal, especially on longer text
- Complements compression well (different detection approach)

## Limitations

- Requires ~2GB of downloads
- Slower (~200ms per sample vs 8ms for default)
- GPT-2 is older — may be less effective at detecting text from newer models
- Memory usage ~1GB at runtime
