# Contributing to Uncanny

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document covers the basics.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunkinfrunkin/uncanny.git
cd uncanny
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

## Running Tests

```bash
make test           # run all tests
make bench          # run benchmarks
make bench-fast     # compression-only benchmark
```

## Project Structure

```

## Adding a New Analyzer

1. Create `src/uncanny/analyzers/your_analyzer.py`
2. Subclass `Analyzer` from `analyzers/base.py`
3. Implement the `analyze(text: str) -> AnalyzerResult` method
4. Register it in `analyzers/__init__.py` and `cli.py`
5. Add a default weight in `ensemble.py`
6. Add tests and benchmark corpus samples if needed

## Adding Corpus Samples

Put `.txt` files in `benchmarks/corpus/ai/` or `benchmarks/corpus/human/`. Each file should be 100-200 words of representative text. Run `make bench` to verify accuracy doesn't regress.

## Pull Requests

- One feature/fix per PR
- Tests must pass (`make test`)
- Benchmark accuracy must not regress below 70% (enforced by `test_bench.py`)
- Keep commits focused and messages clear

## Code Style

- Python 3.10+ with `from __future__ import annotations`
- No unnecessary abstractions — keep it simple
- Type hints on function signatures
- Tests for new functionality

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue on GitHub with:
- What you expected vs what happened
- Sample text that triggered the issue (if applicable)
- Output of `uncanny version`
